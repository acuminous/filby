1. Refactor webhooks to use the interval to group notifications
This could be done by putting a unique constraint on the notifications table
causing a conflict when a notification was added for the same webhook, projection and status
by replacing the existing webhook on conflict, we would

	a) dedupe similar notifications
	b) prevent permanent table growth (by only showing the most recent success & pending)
	c) simplify the notification generation by moving it into the add_park and add_park_calendar functions

2. Demonstrate a rolling calendar by deleting events older than two years
